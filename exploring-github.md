# Git History
**Git** is a free, open-source version control system widely used in the programming world. Git is a technology that is independent of any programming language or computer operating system.

Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, to track changes in source code. Git is accessed primarily through the command line.

The history of the name "git" according to Mr. Torvolds is quite funny. "Git" is British slang for pig-headed or argumentative. This will feel very appropriate at moments when interacting with git. Mr. Torvolds says that while "git" was a random three-letter combination that is pronounceable and was not currently used by any common UNIX command, the true meaning of git can change, depending on your mood:

1. Global Information Tracker: if you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing and light suddenly fills the room.
2. Godd\*\*n Idiotic Truckload of sh\*t: when it breaks.
